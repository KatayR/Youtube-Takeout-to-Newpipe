# Youtube-Takeout-to-Newpipe
This script is made to make transition from Youtube to Newpipe easier.


# What it does?
Takes your Youtube history html file (which you've got from Google Takeout) and converts it to CSV in a compatible format with newpipe.db (which you get can from Export option in Newpipe).

I'll add DB table joining function later.

Requires a free Youtube Api key but feel free to use BeautifulSoup, Youtube-dl or other stuff instead to get more metadata
