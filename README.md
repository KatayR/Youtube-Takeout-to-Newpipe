# Youtube-Takeout-to-Newpipe
This script is made to make transition from Youtube to Newpipe easier.


# What it does?
Takes your Youtube history html file you've got from Google Takeout and converts it to CSV in a compatible format with newpipe.db you get can from Export option in Newpipe.
I'll add DB table joining function later.

Requires a free Youtube Api key
